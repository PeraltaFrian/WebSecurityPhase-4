# [CPRG-312] Web Security: Project Phase 4

This repository contains code for React Frontend **(UploadBox)** and Express Backend **(ExpressApp)**.  
Check the **README.md** file for each of these project to understand how to run these projects.  
To run this project you will need MongoDB, so please install if you don't have it.

**Note**

> In _Project Phase 4_, you have to identify the security issues in your project using a security testing tool.  
> But some students don't have a UI in their project and having a UI makes it easy to run **OWASP ZAP** tool.  
> So I have created these project, basically I took the code of _ABAC lab_ and add a react frontend to it.
